/*
a)
In the first hand you want encrypt the sensitive data in the database so that it is unusable if a hacker manages to access it.
To further increase the security you might also want to limit all direct access to the database so that all the data is manipulated within stored procedures in the database and not by functions in the frontend. It is also important to set appropriate privileges and roles where only the specific roles can access the sensitive data.


b)
1. Stored procedures can be faster than functions written in the frontend using other languages since they are compiled and saved in the cache memory of the database.

2. Stored procedures limit access to the database relation-tables which makes it more secure.

3. If multiple applications want to use the database they can directly use the stored procedure instead of writing their own function. This will reduce duplication of code since it only needs to be in one place, the database.


9.
b. No, because after writing start transaction we are working in an isolated environment in that session (since we disable autocommit mode), therefore the database as seen by all other sessions will be unchanged until the changes in session A are commited (or rolled back but then the database will be unchanged anyways).
c. For the reason stated above the sessions will be completly independent from eachother and isolated. In session B the reservation made in A will not be visible until it is commited in A. If both transactions try to change the same row the second one will be blocked until the first is commited or rolled back. The first session to modify the row will acquire an exclusive lock that will block other sessions from modifying until the lock is released.


10.
a. There was no overbooking that occured, this was because one of the "customers" probably added the booking before the other checked for the amount of free seats.
b. Yes, an overbooking could definetly happen. If two sessions would have checked the amount of free seats before any of them actually inserted the booking then they would both have inserted a booking and we could have an overbooking if both together needed more seats than available.
c. The theoretical case was possible to simulate with a 5 second sleep placed inside the if-statement where free seats have been checked but the booking has not yet been made. This resulted in the session finishing first getting 19 seats left available and the session following getting -2 seats left available.
d. since the school servers are still not functioning Olaf told us that we do not have to answer this particular question.



SECONDARY INDEXES:

Secondary indexes can improve performance when a user wants to search for a row using something else than the primary key.

In our case we could use a secondary index to improve performance when searching for a flight for a specific week. By using week as a secondary index, which is much more useful to a user, it would make searches like this go faster.

It could also be useful to be able to search for passengers by name instead of passport number in an efficient way.
